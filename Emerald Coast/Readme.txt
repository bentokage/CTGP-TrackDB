===WHAT'S NEW?===
==V1.0.1 (02/01/21)==
=Changelog=
- Lowered fall boundary below upper section of the pier 
=Known Issues=
- Various minor shading and vertex color issues
- Spike Gates move over time (spend 5 minutes and you'll see they've moved out of the gate a bit, and I have no idea why this happens)
- Spike Gate shadows and particle effects render incorrectly (ideally I'd like to remove them altogether but was having issues with it)

===ABOUT===

This is an original racetrack based on Emerald Coast, the first level in Sonic Adventure.  I originally picked this level because I thought it would be an easier
project than some of the other ideas floating around in my head that I've been putting off, and while on some level it was, on another level this was the most frustrating
track I've ever made.  I spent (and I'm not even joking) 40-50 hours trying to get a fully rigged whale in this map and failed repeatedly, and finally threw in the towel
and ended up with a fairly inanimate whale as seen in this final project.  I spent a few hours trying to get the shadow below the spike gates to go away and for the
things to stop moving over time (which they will if you sit there for a while) but couldn't figure that out.  Basically, I'm aware the track has a lot of issues, but
I'm honestly so fed up with working on it I'm releasing it so I don't feel any pressure to get it fixed before moving on to other things.

As for issues that won't get fixed, yes I'm aware the UV mapping is weird, but that's how the original textures broke down in Sonic Adventure and it looks weird there too.
I've considered releasing a version that has lower contrast textures since it can look more harsh than your typical Mario Kart track.

All of this is to say I hope you enjoy playing it a lot more than I enjoyed making it!
